Immigration attorneys assist people who are having difficulty understanding and dealing with all current U.S. immigration requirements. The immigration attorney is an advisor/counselor to citizens of foreign countries and immigrants who are interacting with U.S. immigration authorities.  They provide advice and guidance for several matters that include but are not limited to; visa applications, deportation issues, citizenship and naturalization, green and employment for non-citizens. Although Immigration Attorneys do make appearances before immigration judges, in cases such as deportation hearings, typically they spend far less time in court than other attorneys.  The majority of their time is spent acting as mediator between their clients and immigration authorities such as USCIS, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.When looking for an Immigration attorney here are some tips to help you.1.
